# GRAPH
## Graph Data Structure
A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a set of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges. Each node represents an object, and each edge represents a connection between two objects.

## Key Components:

Vertices: The nodes or elements of the graph.
Edges: The connections between vertices. Edges can be directed or undirected.
Weight (Optional): A numerical value associated with an edge, often used to represent distance, cost, or capacity.

## Types of Graphs:

 * Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction (e.g., friendships on social media).
 * Directed Graph: Edges have a direction (e.g., road networks with one-way streets).
 * Weighted Graph: Edges have associated weights (e.g., road networks with distances between cities).
 * Unweighted Graph: Edges do not have associated weights.

## Common Graph Representations:
* Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array where rows and columns represent vertices, and the value at [i][j] indicates the weight of the edge between vertices i and j.
* Adjacency List: A list where each element represents a vertex, and its value is a list of adjacent vertices.

## Applications of Graphs:
* Social Networks: Modeling relationships between people.
* Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Representing maps and networks.
* Transportation Networks: Analyzing routes and traffic flow.
* Recommendation Systems: Suggesting items based on user preferences.
* Computer Networks: Modeling network topologies.
* Circuit Design: Representing electrical circuits.

## Graph Algorithms:
* Breadth-First Search (BFS): Traverses a graph level by level.
* Depth-First Search (DFS): Traverses a graph by exploring as deeply as possible before backtracking.
* Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph.
* Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): Finds a subset of edges that connects all vertices with the minimum total weight.
* Topological Sorting: Orders vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
By understanding the concepts of graphs, their representations, and common algorithms, you can effectively apply them to solve a wide range of problems in various domains.
